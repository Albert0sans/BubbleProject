# Bubble Project

Bubble is the mobile application created to enhance your mood daily with just a click. Bubble features an artificial intelligence-based algorithm that uses user data, weather conditions in their location and severate climate parameters (NASA resources) as input to understand how they are feeling at that moment.

Are you looking for a serotonin boost or need to reduce cortisol? Don't worry, Bubble knows it. Our app predicts hormone levels and suggests challenges and locations based on these results.

Moreover, the app offers users the choice to undertake these challenges individually or in the company of others. This feature of connecting with like-minded groups enables users to become part of a community that shares their common interests.

This is where its name comes from, related to the concept of heterotopia - 'environments within environments.' Each 'bubble' in the app represents a heterotopia where users can experience and interact uniquely. The metaphor of the bubble emphasizes a separate place where interactions and experiences are different from everyday life.
